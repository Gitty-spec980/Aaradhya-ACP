                <h2>Facts about Pigs</h2>
                <p>
                    Pigs are highly intelligent and social animals with excellent memories. They communicate through various grunts and
                    vocalizations. Pigs are also known for their cleanliness and ability to learn, sometimes outperforming dogs in
                    problem-solving tasks according to the BC SPCA.

                    pigs communicate with one another is through distinct grunts and squeals. More than 20 vocalizations have been
                    identified, each one conveying a different message. Mothers have special calls for their piglets, and the piglets learn
                    to recognize their mother’s call. 
                    Exciting new research is being done to create a pig translator – which could be used to monitor how pigs are feeling,
                    and could pave the way for better treatment of pigs on farms.

                    Pigs are intelligent, social animals that enjoy playing, exploring, and cuddling with each other. They are known for
                    their intelligence, even ranking higher than dogs in some areas. Pigs communicate through grunts, squeals, and other
                    vocalizations. They also enjoy keeping clean and will separate their living and eating areas from their "toilets".
