<h1>How I Spend Time</h1>
<p>
    Hello, My name is <mark>Aaradhya Daggumati</mark> and I am going to tell you how <b>I spend my time.</b>
</p>
<p>
    First of all, I love to cook, and bake. I especially <i>LOVED</i> the lemon poppy seeds muffin. One thing I also cooked was <u>noodles,</u> pasta, and I usually help my mom in the kitchen like cutting stuff, peeling potatoes and onions, and mixing the soup and putting in the correct spices.
</p>
<p>
    This is what I do to spend my time.
