<h1> The Honey Blog!</h1>
Hello there! Welcome to the Hone Blog. You are officially our first blogger to enter the website.
<p>
    To start off, <mark>honey bees are social insects known for producing honey and pollinating plants.</mark> They live in colonies with a complex social structure, including a queen, worker bees, and drones. Honey bees are not native to the United States but were
    introduced from <b>Europe and Africa.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Fun fact! Did you know that a honey bee can fly up to <i>15 miles per hour?</i> A honey bee worker only makes an average of <i>1/12 of a teaspoon in her lifetime.</i> One ounce of honey would fuel a bees flight around the world. A pound honey is made by 2 million flower
    visits.
</p>
<p>
    Honey bees, although one of the most popular bees, represent only a <i>small percent</i> of bee species. Honey bees are the
    only surviving group of bees from the Apini tribe, which is under the Apis genus. They are known for producing and
    storing honey, or liquefied sugar, as well as building impressively large nests using wax secreted by workers in a
    particular colony.
