<h1> The Honey Blog!</h1>
Hello there! Welcome to the Hone Blog. You are officially our first blogger to enter the website.
<p>
    To start off, <mark>honey bees are social insects known for producing honey and pollinating plants.</mark> They live in colonies with a complex social structure, including a queen, worker bees, and drones. Honey bees are not native to the United States but were
    introduced from <b>Europe and Africa.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Fun fact! Did you know that a honey bee can fly up to <i>15 miles per hour?</i> A honey bee worker only makes an average of <i>1/12 of a teaspoon in her lifetime.</i> One ounce of honey would fuel a bees flight around the world. A pound honey is made by 2 million flower
    visits.

    I hope you enjoyed this blog and learned stuff from honey bees. See you next time!
